# Viki - AI with Personal Assistants

## Overview

Welcome to the Viki project, an AI with personal assistants. This repository, `main` branch, contains the latest developments and optimizations for Viki. Please note that most of the code has been moved to the `Viki-Beta` branch for better version control and organization. The `main` branch primarily focuses on refining and expanding the capabilities of Viki, with the aim of making it more efficient and feature-rich.

## Background

Viki was initially created during my 10th-grade years, and its codebase was stored in this repository for version control. However, due to the lack of organizational structure, the majority of the code has been migrated to the `Viki-Beta` branch, where you can find a more detailed README and information about the earlier development stages.
