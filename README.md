# Viki-Beta

## Overview

**Note:** This branch contains code written during 10th and 11th grades before implementing efficient version control and code organization practices. The code may lack formatting and readability due to early learning experiences.

## Project Description

Viki-Beta is a pre-coded AI project developed during 10th and 11th grades. The project was exhibited at the school exhibition, following an exhibition-style code structure. The AI, inspired by virtual assistants like Alexa and Google Assistant, performs various tasks, including voice-to-text, text-to-speech, sending emails, telling jokes, providing information from the internet, playing music, and more.

## Functionality Highlights (Last Version in Viki-Beta Branch)

- **Voice-to-Text and Text-to-Speech:**
  - Allows users to interact with the AI using voice commands and receives responses in speech.

- **Email Functionality:**
  - Can send emails and read emails from a dedicated mail ID.

- **Face Recognition:**
  - Utilizes OpenCV for face recognition to identify a specific face.

- **Chatbot Feature:**
  - Responds to specific chat using a directory-based chatbot feature.

- **Home Automation:**
  - Controls lights by sending serial messages to an Arduino with a relay switch for home automation.
